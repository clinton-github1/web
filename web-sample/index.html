            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p><b>Downe House High School(D.H.H.S)</b> is a christian-based secondary school situated in Homa Bay County,Karachuonyo constituency,
Koyugi Location,Bala village.It is one of the Kenya private schools following the the Kenya curriculum of secondary schools.The school was constructed in the year 2008 when the mother primary school,<b>Bala Mercy Primary School</b> was
going to send out its first KCPE(Kenya Certificate of Primary Education) pupils to various government secondary schools. <p>Since Bala Mercy 
Primary School was under <b>Bala Mercy Children's Centre and Orphanage Project</b> which was taking care of over 500 pupils by then,candidates 
included,most of the pupils raised their concern on their fear of the end of their education life since they were going to pay high amount of 
school fees, which almost all could not afford due to their family backgrounds.<p>With deep love from his heart,care and sympathy for the pupils,
<b>REV.DOMINIC OCHOO</b>,the school director saw it best to continue showing his mercy for these less fortunate pupils by ensuring they could continue
with their education.The school was to subsidize the fee for every student,both for the B.M primary alumnis and other pupils from other schools
 who could not afford the public secondary school fees.This boosted the hope in many families who had lost hope for the better future of their children.</p>
 <p>In the year <b>2009</b>,the school began its operation with a good number of turn up of the hopeful students.It started from form one,form two
 by <b>2010</b>,<b>2011</b> form three and finally <b>2012</b> it produced its first products of <b>KCSE Examination</b>(Kenya Certificate of Secondary 
 Education) who joined most public colleges and universities under Government Sponsorships and aids from other organisations which were pleased by 
 the students performance.<p>The school is still making its best effort 
 to produce more useful people to the society,a society full of literates,a society that turns dreams to reality.The church Bala Faith 
 Christian outreach centre-[WORD AFLAME FELLOWSHIP CHURCH MISSION] gives maximum support in ensuring the students have the maximum discipline among 
 themselves,with staffs, parents,outsiders, and good personal relations with God.
